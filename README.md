# Aptoide Explicit Images Detector

Project presented for Aptoide Summer Internship, 2016.

# Goal
Write an API that is capable with at most 6% error accuracy of checking if an app has mature content.
Project Description

# Description
When uploading new apps, there is a box to the user check if it is explicit content. But what if the user marks explicit content as non-explicit content? Our engineers would have to, minutes after the app has been uploaded, change the settings by themselves.

This project tries to automate some things about that process, trying to give more feedback about the probability of the app having explicit content.

The main goal was to develop a system that detected, with at most 20% of error percentage, explicit content on apps.

The goal was achieved with at most 6% of error percentage.
